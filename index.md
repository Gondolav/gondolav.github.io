# The Setting

**Chicago** is the third most populous and the second most visited city in the United States. It is an international hub for finance, culture, commerce, industry, education, technology, telecommunications and transportation. The Chicago area [has one of the highest gross domestic product (GDP) in the world](https://www.bea.gov/system/files/2018-09/gdp_metro0918_0.pdf) and the [most balanced economy in the U.S.](http://www.worldbusinesschicago.com/economy), due to its high level of diversification. Moreover, the *Windy City* ranks first globally in the [2018 Time Out City Life Index](https://www.timeout.com/chicago/news/chicago-named-the-worlds-best-city-for-having-it-all-012918), a quality of life survey, and seventh for the highest number of [ultra-high-net-worth residents](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/finance-banking/these-are-cities-most-ultra-rich-people): roughly 3,300 residents are worth more than $30 million. Nevertheless, Chicago is also a city of contradictions and inequalities: according to the 2008-2012 U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, about 18.3% of families and 22.1% of the population lived below the poverty line.

# Inspections and Food Establishments

Chicago is home to 16,000 food establishments like restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, wholesalers, lunchrooms, mobile food vendors and more. The city has many upscale dining establishments as well as many ethnic restaurant districts, including the Mexican American neighbourhoods, such as Pilsen along 18th street, and La Villita along 26th Street; the Puerto Rican enclave of Paseo Boricua in the Humboldt Park neighbourhood; Greektown, along South Halsted Street, immediately west of downtown; Little Italy, along Taylor Street; Chinatown in Armour Square; Polish Patches in West Town; Little Seoul in Albany Park around Lawrence Avenue; Little Vietnam near Broadway in Uptown; and the Desi area, along Devon Avenue in West Ridge.

To ensure the compliance with the [Chicago Food Code](https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/cdph/food_env/general/Food_Protection/FoodCodeRules_Effective_Feb12019.pdf), the **Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH)** conducts routine, unannounced food inspections, also called *canvass inspections*. The goals of these inspections are:
- to ensure the immediate safety of restaurant customers and employees;
- to prevent foodborne illness outbreaks.
- to help the public learn which restaurants adhere to public health regulations.

CDPH inspects most food establishments twice a year, with other establishments deemed as lower risk inspected once a year or once every other year. In addition to routine canvass inspections, CDPH also conducts license inspections for newly-opened businesses, complaint inspections in response to submitted concerns or suspected food poisoning, and re-inspections for issues arising from canvass inspections that require correction.

The inspections' results are available [online](http://webapps1.chicago.gov/healthinspection/inspection.jsp).

# The Analysis

We analysed food inspections' results to give an overview of the city's food safety over the last decade. The aim was to identify patterns at the social and geographical levels, focusing our efforts in pinpointing **where to eat safely in Chicago**. With our work, we hope to raise awareness about the Chicago's food safety landscape and instruct people on the quality of the establishments they regularly visit.

In this article, we first take a look at the different facilities' predispositions to inspection failure. Then, we compare famous fast-food restaurant chains, highlighting very interesting findings, and we also present some curious facts about Food Code violations. Next, we address our main objective: showing which neighbourhoods are the safest food-wise and explore the evolution of the neighbourhoods' safety throughout time. Finally, at the end of the article, we assess the usefulness and the potential effects of the inspections.

We use the [Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning website](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/data/community-snapshots) to interpret in a deeper way our results, as they provide community snapshots that summarize demographics, housing, employment, transportation habits, retail sales, property values, and land use in all 77 Chicago community areas, which correspond to the "neighbourhoods" we are considering.
We have built small tables with the different features we found interesting on the best and worse Community Areas according to the two main aspects we considered, namely the **RISK 1 (HIGH)** rate and the **PASS** rate.

## Facility types and their predisposition to failure

Food inspection concerns a very large variety of catering-related services. Let's see if and how the facility types and inspection results are tied to one another. As one would expect, the distribution of these facilities is extremely uneven: restaurants are by far the most represented type in Chicago counting 18,073 distinct establishments, which corresponds to 60% of the city's facilities. It is followed by grocery stores with 5'792 instances (20%) and by schools with a total of 1'125 facilities (4%). Let's now take a look at the average fail rate per facility type:

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/images/graph_facility_types.png" width="900px">
</div>

It appears that three facility types in particular have a higher failure rate than the rest:
   - the liquor stores
   - the wholesale distributors
   - the taverns and bars

A way of interpreting this would be to notice that when the main sold item is alcohol, less care is taken in making the facilities clean and safe. As for wholesale distributors, their size and the fact that they are mostly used by companies rather than individuals could explain a lack of neatness. Moreover, for taverns it could be harder to keep it as clean as other establishments because of the behavior of drunk clients.

TODO: Discuss low fail rates

## Fast-food restaurant chains

Fast-foods restaurants are undeniably forming a huge sector of modern catering and are well-known to the average consumer. Conducting a study about the popular chains located in Chicago is a good way to reveal insights about food quality in these establishments and find out how they compare to one another. We selected the chains that had the largest number of open restaurants in the city in order to have stable and accurate data. Let's take a look at their inspection result distribution:

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/images/graph_food_chains.png" width="900px">
</div>

The chain with the highest fail rate is **Papa John's Pizza**, followed by **Harold's Chicken Shack** and **Flat Top Grill**, which has however a significantly lower number of facilities (31 **Harold's Chicken Shack** and 19 **Flat Top Grill** versus 102 **McDonald's**). **Starbucks** and **Taco Bell** distinguish themselves by being the two chains with the highest pass rates, both around 80%. As for **Freshii**, **Wingstop** and **Domino's Pizza**, they have the highest **PASS W/ CONDITIONS** rate. Hence their low pass rate shows rather that some of the establishments could be a bit more careful than a truly dirty fast-food restaurant chain.

Gathering these chains by the type of food they sell, we can notice that pizza restaurants have a higher tendency to fail inspections, whereas sandwich facilities appear to be quite successful in general.

We may have to be careful with those results: the huge gap (302 **Subway**'s versus only 18 **Papa John's Pizza**'s) between the number of facilities could make the comparison biased. Indeed, we can see that the three chains with more than 100 restaurants in Chicago (namely **Subway**, **Dunkin Donuts** and **McDonald's**) all are middle-ranked in terms of pass rate, probably because they benefit/suffer from having a lot of facilities in Chicago.

Overall, we observe a mean fail rate of 18.4% for fast-food chains in Chicago city, whereas classical restaurants average to 21.4%. This significant difference indicates that, surprisingly, fast-food facilities tend to have a cleaner cooking and serving environment. It can be explained by the fact that these restaurants are part of big corporate groups and have therefore strict and well-defined hygiene rules.

TODO: fail rate/income analysis ?

## Risk Analysis Per Neighbourhood

One of the features we could use to perform an analysis of these food inspections is the **Risk** associated with each inspection. By risk here we mean the possibility of "adversely affecting the public's health". It can take 3 different values: **RISK 1 (HIGH)**, **RISK 2 (MEDIUM)** and **RISK 3 (LOW)**. Indeed, the establishments which are judged more risky will be more inspected than others. We chose to judge the neighbourhoods by their percentage of high risk food facilities as it appeared to be an accurate measure we could get from this feature. Indeed, such a test would probably tell us something about the safest places in Chicago food-wise.
We built the following map, which colours each community area according to its **RISK 1 (HIGH)** rate.



<div style="text-align:center;">
  <iframe src="maps/risk_map.html" width="80%" height="600px"></iframe>
</div>

The areas with the most important **RISK 1 (HIGH)** rate are mostly located in the Central, Far North, Northwest and North sides of Chicago. This is rather surprising since these parts of the city are mostly populated with middle-class and well-off populations. On the other hand, the Southwest and South sides of Chicago tend to have a lower risk rate, i.e. in districts with a much lower median income.

Let us now go deeper in our interpretation thanks to the [Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning website](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/data/community-snapshots), as mentioned above.

Here is the name of the five community areas with the lowest high risk rate:
1. **Garfield Park**
2. **Englewood**
3. **Bridgeport**
4. **Grand Crossing**
5. **New City**

As expected, most of them are located in the Southwest Side, except for **Garfield Park** which can be found in the middle of the West Side of Chicago. In general, these neighbourhoods present similar ethnicity, education level and income level. Unfortunately, these indicators are low: with the exception of **Bridgeport**, in these neighbourhoods 70% of the population earns less than 50'000$ a year and less than 25% of the inhabitants have a university degree. Here, **Bridgeport** looks more like an outlier with its different ethnicity, its important median income and its higher education level being as twice as high as the others.

Consequently, from these results, a good risk rate seems very surprisingly to be linked to the (lack of) wealth and education of a community area.

We now focus on five worst neighbourhoods according to their risk rate, listed here:
1. **Lincoln Square**
2. **East Side**
3. **Norwood Park**
4. **Armour Square**
5. **Edison Park**

It is quite hard to find common patterns to these five community areas. Geographically, four of them are located in the suburbs of Chicago: **Lincoln Square**,  **Norwood Park** and **Edison Park** are located in the Far North Side while **Edison park** is a Far Southeast Side neighbourhood, As for **Armour Square**, it is a central neighbourhood. The ethnicity is also heterogeneous, except for the African-American population that appears to be minority. As for the education and income levels, they vary widely from one community area to the other, e.g. from a poor median income of 26'500 $ per year in **Armour Square** to a very high 99'200$ per year in **Edison Park**.

Hence, a bad risk rate of a Chicago neighbourhood doesn't seem to be related to its location, its ethnicity, its education level or its income level.

To conclude, we can say that this *a priori* feature which is the risk doesn't really seem to be related to the location of the facility. The only apparent correlation is that poorer neighbourhoods seem to have less risky facilities on average than the others. We can view this as a good point as it could mean that the city doesn't rely on education or income level of the neighbourhood  of a given establishment to determine its risk. On the other hand, these results could also be seen as a lack of consideration for these left-aside areas whereas they would definitely need more attention from the municipality. Let us perform a result analysis to unravel these questions.

## Result Analysis Per Neighbourhood

Another very interesting feature present in those inspections is obviously the **Result** of the inspection. We decided to focus on the three main possible results: **PASS**, **PASS W/ CONDITIONS** and **FAIL**. Gathering the two first possibilities into a global pass, this provided us with a pass and a fail rates summing up to 1. We can now portray the community areas by their percentage of successful inspections and get the following map:

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <iframe src="maps/result_map.html" width="80%" height="600px"></iframe>
</div>

The central district **Loop** as well as the edge areas of the city share the highest rates when regarding the pass inspections. They are wealthy neighbourhoods, which could explain why a peculiar care seems to be taken in making food facilities safe. We clearly cannot say the same about the South Side of Chicago, which gathers the Community Areas with highest **FAIL** rates.

As for the risk analysis, we deepen our interpretation thanks to the [Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning website](https://www.cmap.illinois.gov/data/community-snapshots).

We start with the top five community areas with respect to their pass rate:
1. **Clearing**
2. **O'Hare**
3. **Ashburn**
4. **Mount Greenwood**
5. **Loop**

**O'Hare** is the large community area at the extreme northwest of Chicago, while **Clearing**, **Ashburn** and **Mount Greenwood** are southwest neighbourhoods. On the other hand, **Loop** is the very heart of the city.
These five community areas have quite diverse populations in terms of ethnicity, education level and income level. Nevertheless, we can notice that at least 25% of their population has a university degree and that they all have a median income of 50'000$ per year or more, two high statistics. In particular, **Loop**, the central business district in the downtown area of the city and home to Chicago's commercial core, has a huge university degree rate (83%) and median income (100'000 \$ per year).

Overall, given these results, we could hypothesize that high pass rates are related to prosperous neighbourhoods.

Let us now focus on the five community areas with the worst pass rate in Chicago:
1. **Oakland**
2. **Woodlawn**
3. **Grand Boulevard**
4. **Grand Crossing**
5. **Washington Park**

The first two things to notice are that the ethnicity of these community areas in terms of pass rate is predominantly African-American and that they are very close to each other geographically as they are all located in the South Side. If the percentage of the population with a university degree is not that low, the median income on the other hand is very limited. On average, 70% of the population of these neighbourhoods makes less than 50'000$ per year.

The conclusion to draw here is rather clear: a low pass rate seems to be closely related to the (lack of) wealth and education of a Community Area. In particular, districts with an African-American population appear to be more struck by food safety issues. Besides, the fact that they all are neighbours seems to point out a large area of the city with safety issues regarding the food facilities.

Consequently, the inclination of a neighbourhood to have a good **PASS** rate appears to be somehow linked to its prosperity. It would then be safer to look for a restaurant or a groceries store in the wealth community areas of Chicago, namely the Central, Far North, Southwest and Far Southwest Sides of Chicago. We could see this as logical since facilities in richer areas may have more funds to make their place conform to all the safety norms. We could also consider it as some kind of injustice since the poorer are once again disadvantaged with more precarious establishments.

## Evolution of the Pass Rate Over Time

\* insert result map over time \*

It is quite hard to target repeating features as the map changes a lot throughout the years. If, of course, the neighbourhoods that we previously identified tend to have a higher/lower pass rate per year. But the majority of the other areas have good and bad years inspection-wise. For example, **Riverdale** goes from a poor rate in 2014 to a great one in 2015 before falling in 2016 to an even worse rate than in 2014.

When comparing the years between them, we can notice that at first the food inspections were quite severe. This is revealed by the proportion of yellow/red neighbourhoods from 2010 to 2012. The map becomes much greener for the three subsequent years before getting slightly more red again after 2015. Maybe there was a bit of change in the pass standards that made more establishments fail there food inspections. As for 2018, we could be biased by the fact that we only have data for the first half of the year.

As a general conclusion for this analysis, we can affirm that facilities which fail their inspections appear to be concentrated in poor neighbourhoods, mainly inhabited by African-American people. We can make a link here with a larger problem in Chicago: the [legacy of segregation](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/03/chicago-segregation-poverty/556649/?fbclid=IwAR2BkpgrKDsfh1mc-oAMug5Hd6fOuPBIjLxtH0wEj4xxZhalmpM0ZAYBcRk). Indeed, the majority of the money generated by the city of Chicago is invested in the wealthiest neighbourhoods, especially in the **Loop**, i.e. the Central Business District. It would be a good idea for the city hall to focus on those left-aside community areas and improve the quality of the food establishments there.

-> no access to education for poor populations and less and less job opportunities without a diploma

# What Have We Learned?

While analyzing the inspections' results, we discovered that **severe inequalities**, linked to the population's wealth, ethnicity and education, exist even in the context of food safety; the safest restaurants are, indeed, gathered mostly in prosperous neighbourhoods. As such, one possible way of reducing social inequalities in Chicago would surely be improving the quality of food establishments.
