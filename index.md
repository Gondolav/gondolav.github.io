# The setting

**Chicago** is the third most populous and the second most visited city in the United States. It is an international hub for finance, culture, commerce, industry, education, technology, telecommunications and transportation. The Chicago area [has one of the highest gross domestic product (GDP) in the world](https://www.bea.gov/system/files/2018-09/gdp_metro0918_0.pdf) and the [most balanced economy in the U.S.](http://www.worldbusinesschicago.com/economy), due to its high level of diversification. Moreover, the *Windy City* ranks first globally in the [2018 Time Out City Life Index](https://www.timeout.com/chicago/news/chicago-named-the-worlds-best-city-for-having-it-all-012918), a quality of life survey, and seventh for the highest number of [ultra-high-net-worth residents](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/finance-banking/these-are-cities-most-ultra-rich-people): roughly 3,300 residents are worth more than $30 million. Nevertheless, Chicago is also a city of contradictions and inequalities: according to the 2008-2012 U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, about 18.3% of families and 22.1% of the population lived below the poverty line.

# Inspections and food establishments

Chicago is home to 16,000 food establishments like restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, wholesalers, lunchrooms, mobile food vendors and more. The city has many upscale dining establishments as well as many ethnic restaurant districts, including the Mexican American neighbourhoods, such as Pilsen along 18th street, and La Villita along 26th Street; the Puerto Rican enclave of Paseo Boricua in the Humboldt Park neighbourhood; Greektown, along South Halsted Street, immediately west of downtown; Little Italy, along Taylor Street; Chinatown in Armour Square; Polish Patches in West Town; Little Seoul in Albany Park around Lawrence Avenue; Little Vietnam near Broadway in Uptown; and the Desi area, along Devon Avenue in West Ridge.

To ensure the compliance with the [Chicago Food Code](https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/cdph/food_env/general/Food_Protection/FoodCodeRules_Effective_Feb12019.pdf), the **Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH)** conducts routine, unannounced food inspections, also called *canvass inspections*. The goals of these inspections are:
- to ensure the immediate safety of restaurant customers and employees;
- to prevent foodborne illness outbreaks.
- to help the public learn which restaurants adhere to public health regulations.

CDPH inspects most food establishments twice a year, with other establishments deemed as lower risk inspected once a year or once every other year. In addition to routine canvass inspections, CDPH also conducts license inspections for newly-opened businesses, complaint inspections in response to submitted concerns or suspected food poisoning, and re-inspections for issues arising from canvass inspections that require correction.

The inspections' results are available [online](http://webapps1.chicago.gov/healthinspection/inspection.jsp).

# The analysis

We analyzed food inspections' results to give an overview of the city's food safety over the last decade. The aim was to identify patterns at the social and geographical levels, focusing our efforts in pinpointing **where to eat safely in Chicago**. With our work, we hope to raise awareness about the Chicago's food safety landscape and instruct people on the quality of the establishments they regularly visit.

In this article, we first take a look at the different facilities' predispositions to inspection failure. Then, we compare famous fast-food restaurant chains, highlighting very interesting findings, and we also present some curious facts about Food Code violations. Next, we address our main objective: showing which neighbourhoods are the safest food-wise and explore the evolution of the neighbourhoods' safety throughout time. Finally, at the end of the article, we assess the usefulness and the potential effects of the inspections. 

# What have we learned?

While analyzing the inspections' results, we discovered that **severe inequalities**, linked to the population's wealth, ethnicity and education, exist even in the context of food safety; the safest restaurants are, indeed, gathered mostly in prosperous neighbourhoods. As such, one possible way of reducing social inequalities in Chicago would surely be improving the quality of food establishments.
